A database used by a college’s application stores the relationship between students and the courses they are enrolled in. 
We have information for each STUDENT (such as name, date of birth, date of enrollment, student-id) and COURSE (course code, instructor, etc.).
In real life, a student takes several courses simultaneously while a subject is studied by several students. 
We need to capture this many-to-many relationship in our database. 
From the above information, what is the minimum number of tables required to structure this database in accordance with the rules of 2NF normalization?
