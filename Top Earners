We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. 
Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. 
Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

 select MAX(salary*months), COUNT(*) from Employee where (salary * months) >= (select MAX(salary * months) from employee);
